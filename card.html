		<div class="animal-info">
			<p class="interesting-fact">Also called the "human fish" by locals because
				 of its skin color. When exposed to light, it will gradually turn
				 dark.</p>
			<ul class="properties-list">
				<li><span class="label">Scientific Name</span>: Proteus anguinus</li>
				<li><span class="label">Lifespan</span>: 60 - 100 years</li>
				<li><span class="label">Length</span>: 20 - 30 centimeters</li>

			</ul>
			<p>This animal is most notable for its adaptations to a life of complete
				 darkness in its underground habitat. The olm's eyes are undeveloped,
				 leaving it blind, while its other senses, particularly those of smell
				 and hearing, are acutely developed. It also lacks any pigmentation in
				 its skin. It has three toes on its forelimbs, but only two toes on its
				 hind feet.</p>
